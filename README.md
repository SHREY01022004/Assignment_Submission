Create a .env file in the server directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
env
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yourMongoUsername:yourMongoPassword@yourClusterURL/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5001
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
3. Frontend Setup

Implemented Features
1. Tour Packages Page
Displays a list of available tour packages.
Each package includes a title, description, and price.
Packages are fetched from a MongoDB database.
2. Package Booking
Users can view packages and fill out a booking form.
The form collects customer details such as name, email, phone number, number of travelers, and special requests.
Upon form submission, booking details are saved to MongoDB.
3. Admin Panel
Add New Package: Admin can add new tour packages using a form.
The form includes fields for title, description, and price.
After submission, the new package is added to the MongoDB database and appears on the page.
4. MongoDB Integration
All tour packages and booking requests are stored in MongoDB.
The backend communicates with MongoDB to store and retrieve data.
